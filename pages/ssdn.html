      <h1>Memory safety</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraphs">
      <p>
        Memory safety is the process to use the memory in a way that it does not
        create any problem as if we don't care about the safety of the memory
        while doing our programming then it will cause programs to crash
        unexpectedly and the program will do an intended behavior.
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p>
        Some of the programming languages has built in memory safety mechanism
        like Java, Rust, C#, Python and Javascript and some of them don't have
        memory safery mechanism like C, C++ and assembly.
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p>
        Memory safety is a very big issue in software products and many
        researched shows that many vulnerabilites are because of memory safety
        like Microsoft estimate that 70% vulnerabiliites in their products over
        the last 10 years are just caused by memory safety issue. Google also
        mension that 90% of the Android vulnerablities are caused by this. So
        from the Secure Software development memoty safety is the main focus.

      <h2>Out of Bounds Reads and Writes</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraphs">
      <p>
        Out of bounds reads means that we try to read the memory location which
        we are not supposed to read let me explain this with example. Let's
        consider we have a to do list with ten items if we ask for the eleventh
        item then? yes we should receive an error and same should happen if we
        try to get the memory position less than 0. But the issue is the
        programming language which is not memory safe will not thorow an error
        and it will let you do this and this is dangrous because if you try to
        get the 11th item that may be contain some other data or may be that
        will be the 1st item of other to do list.
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p>
        The same is out of bounds write if there is no memory safety then you
        will write to wrong location of memory and may overwrite some ones else
        data in memory so that's why memory safety is the important part in
        secure software developmenmt.

      <h2>Use After Free</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraphs">
      <p>
        Use after free bug means that we deleted some data in a memeory but
        again we try to get that data now if we don't use memory safe
        mechanism/language then we will get the data but a wrong data because we
        have already deleted our data but that location may contain some other
        data. Like if we delete the to do list and we requiest to get the 5th
        item so that one is deleted but still we will get data from that memeory
        location and if we use memory safe language then it will thorow an
        error.
